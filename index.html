                        As students of Physics and related disciplines at
                        universities across the UK, we write in response to the
                        proposed reduction in grant funding within the STFC’s
                        programmes, particularly affecting physics. While the
                        overall STFC budget may not have declined in headline
                        terms, rising costs and inflation have significantly
                        reduced the funding available for competitive grants,
                        particularly in PPAN (Particle Physics, Astronomy and
                        Nuclear Physics). We believe these reductions would
                        undermine the goals of innovation and growth that the UK
                        science policy seeks to advance, as well as harm the
                        academic standing of higher education institutions in
                        the UK.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Top-quality researchers from around the globe are drawn
                        to the UK for its research excellence. These minds teach
                        in our top institutions and make the UK the global
                        powerhouse of higher education that it currently is,
                        which attracts both domestic and international students.
                        These top research-active academics teach students to
                        think rigorously, creatively, and independently — skills
                        which companies, governments, and academic institutions,
                        in the UK and abroad, highly respect and seek in
                        graduates.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is the ability and flexibility to research deeply
                        across a range of topics that attracts the best minds in
                        the world, who go on to teach these students. While not
                        all of their students become researchers, they become
                        professionals in STEM-related fields. They move into
                        technology, defence, artificial intelligence,
                        engineering, finance, data science, government and
                        education. These industries and sectors highly depend on
                        individuals trained in these high-quality research
                        environments, as they produce the analytical depth and
                        problem-solving capabilities that make physics graduates
                        valuable to the wider economy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The curiosity-driven research supported by STFC plays a
                        fundamental role in cultivating these capabilities.
                        Unlike narrow or focussed research, foundational
                        research encourages and requires students and early
                        career researchers to connect ideas between disparate
                        topics. This nurtures the intellectual flexibility that
                        is critical in innovation, allowing unconventional ideas
                        to be explored in novel directions. In an economy
                        increasingly dependent on cross-sector collaboration and
                        creative problem solving, skills gained by
                        curiosity-driven research are not simply advantageous;
                        they are essential. If we weaken the ecosystem that
                        produces these skills, then the whole system is harmed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Weakening the research base erodes the foundations that
                        make higher education in the UK internationally
                        attractive. Reductions in available grant funding for
                        fundamental research, therefore, would not only affect
                        the immediate academic community, but would carry
                        consequences into the production of highly skilled STEM
                        graduates that are essential to the current and future
                        strength, growth and stability of the broader UK
                        economy. This strength is reflected in the UK’s current
                        global academic standing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        UK universities currently rank among the best in the
                        world. According to the QS World University Rankings, 28
                        out of the top 250 global universities in 2025 are
                        British institutions (QS Quacquarelli Symonds 2026), as
                        well as 25 of the world’s top 250 institutions in
                        Physics and Astronomy (QS Quacquarelli Symonds 2026).
                        However, the relative share of the top-ranked
                        universities has declined since 2015, when 34 of the top
                        250 institutions were UK institutions (QS Quacquarelli
                        Symonds 2015). During the same period, other countries,
                        such as mainland China, have increased their global
                        prominence. By focussing on the mean ranking, we can see
                        the overall trends clearly. From 2015 to 2025, the mean
                        rank of the top 10 UK universities has dropped from 22.2
                        to 32.2, while the mean ranking of mainland Chinese
                        universities has increased from 162.1 to 100.2.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If we look at the public research funding during this
                        period, we can see how these changes occurred alongside
                        national investment trajectories. In the “Double
                        First-Class” initiative, Chinese universities saw
                        significant investment into universities and research,
                        which resulted in improvements to the higher educational
                        infrastructure and overall growth to Chinese academic
                        output (Liu, Luo and Liu 2023). The UK higher education
                        sector, in contrast, has faced real-term funding
                        pressure. Although funding has remained relatively flat,
                        rising operational costs, inflation and broader
                        financial strain have limited the growth of UK
                        universities (PwC and Universities UK 2024).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This financial pressure is not hypothetical. A 2024
                        report by PwC and Universities UK finds that funding per
                        domestic student in England is now at its lowest
                        real-terms level in over 25 years, while operational
                        costs have continued to grow. Around 40% of institutions
                        surveyed reported operating in a deficit (PwC and
                        Universities UK 2024). Beyond this, the proposed
                        reductions in grant funding have resulted in concerns
                        that spread beyond fundamental research, with some
                        physics departments even fearing closure (Butterworth
                        2026). Hence, in a globally competitive higher education
                        market, sustained investment in fundamental physics is
                        essential for broad institutional stability, prestige
                        and maintaining a comprehensive competitive advantage in
                        research and innovation.

                        For students such as ourselves, considering our
                        prospects in careers in research and high-skilled STEM
                        sectors, this sustained funding is necessary. When
                        deciding to pursue postgraduate study or an academic
                        career, the stability of a country's research
                        environment and its ambitions are essential. As highly
                        mobile young individuals, in an increasingly
                        international academic landscape, we naturally gravitate
                        towards countries that demonstrate a long-term
                        commitment to funding research. If the UK is perceived
                        as reducing its investment in fundamental research,
                        while other nations expand theirs, talented graduates
                        will be forced to seek opportunities elsewhere. Not out
                        of disloyalty, but out of necessity.

                        The researchers who leave today are those who would
                        contribute to the next generation of foundational
                        discoveries. History has taught us that what often
                        starts as a highly abstract area of theoretical physics
                        ends up being an essential part of whole industries and
                        the basis of many modern technologies.

                    <p>
                        James Clerk Maxwell's unification of electricity and
                        magnetism was initially seen as highly mathematical
                        theoretical work, but it is now the foundation of all
                        modern telecommunications, such as WiFi, radar, and
                        radio, to name a few. Another example could be the
                        discovery of electromagnetic induction by Michael
                        Faraday. Though its scientific merits were immediately
                        obvious, electricity at the time was a lab curiosity.
                        Faraday’s discovery led to the development of electrical
                        generators, motors and the electrification of modern
                        society.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We note that both examples given (of many) are by
                        physicists working in British institutions, exploring
                        foundational physics that resulted in applications into
                        technologies that revolutionised the world and created
                        numerous industries in the UK and beyond. Maintaining a
                        sustained commitment to fundamental research is
                        therefore essential if the UK is to remain a global
                        leader in science, innovation and advanced industries.
                        Such achievements are only possible within a stable and
                        well-supported research environment, which strongly
                        encourages collaboration and talent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Research ecosystems and their associated networks are
                        not easily rebuilt once weakened. If departments shrink
                        and top international talent leave for more stable
                        positions abroad, the UK’s academic reputation, which
                        was built over generations, will likely erode, and
                        future industries may emerge elsewhere. Research
                        networks would break down, and experts would disperse to
                        other countries. Building research excellence takes
                        decades of sustained investment, but contraction can
                        occur within a single funding cycle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In summary, as students, we fear that the current
                        contraction in available grant funding would result in
                        immediate and measurable consequences. We urge the UKRI
                        to take immediate action to avoid such a situation,
                        which would weaken both the quality and breadth of
                        research undertaken at UK institutions. It would reduce
                        the diversity of expertise to teach and supervise new
                        students in STEM disciplines and narrow the range of
                        advanced subjects offered. Over time, this would shrink
                        the pool of highly skilled STEM professionals who go
                        from research into advanced industry roles, finance,
                        defence, technology and education in the UK. Retaining
                        these individuals is essential for strengthening the
                        UK’s economic resilience in an increasingly competitive,
                        international world.
                    </p>

                    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

                        sciences across the UK.
