                    <p>
                        We write as early-career researchers within the Particle
                        Physics, Astronomy and Nuclear physics (PPAN) community
                        from across the United Kingdom (UK), in response to
                        recent announcements on UK Research and Innovation’s
                        investment approach and the emerging funding
                        architecture for the 2026–2030 period. UKRI has set out
                        a transition toward a more focused, outcomes-driven
                        funding model, alongside statements that overall
                        investment is rising and that curiosity-driven research
                        remains protected.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, we are concerned that aspects of the new
                        funding framework, as currently implemented, risk
                        eroding the UK's foundational capability in fundamental
                        science through mechanisms that disproportionately
                        affect early-career researchers and cannot be reversed
                        on typical Spending Review timescales. We are therefore
                        compelled to write now, as the present combination of
                        uncertainty, delay, and re-prioritisation in
                        early-career pathways risks the loss of a generation
                        from the UK research and industrial ecosystem.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We note in particular the recent communication from the
                        Executive Chair of the Science and Technology Facilities
                        Council outlining a period of portfolio-wide
                        re-prioritisation within the PPAN programme, including
                        further reductions in new grants and a move towards a
                        more concentrated and sustained funding profile. This
                        process is occurring within the context of a rising
                        overall UKRI budget and a stated commitment to protect
                        curiosity-driven research. It is therefore essential
                        that the mechanisms by which re-prioritisation is
                        implemented do not unintentionally concentrate risk onto
                        people-based research and early-career pathways,
                        particularly where facilities, infrastructure, and
                        long-term operational commitments are funded alongside
                        staffing and training. Without explicit safeguards,
                        early-career researchers become the implicit buffer for
                        system-level adjustment, with consequences that are
                        rapid, internationally mobile, and effectively
                        irreversible.
                    </p>

                    <h3>
                        Fundamental science is enabling infrastructure, not
                        discretionary activity
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        Curiosity-driven fundamental science is not in tension
                        with innovation-led growth. On the contrary, it is an
                        enabling infrastructure upon which long-term
                        technological leadership, resilience, and sovereignty
                        depend. Many of the technologies that now underpin the
                        UK economy — spanning computing, communications, medical
                        imaging, advanced materials, artificial intelligence
                        (AI), and emerging quantum technologies — originated in
                        fundamental research that required and created entirely
                        new technological trajectories before their commercial
                        relevance was recognised.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Discovery science does not simply precede innovation; it
                        actively shapes the landscape in which innovation
                        occurs. It generates the people, capabilities, and
                        optionality that allow industry to form, adapt, and
                        scale. An innovation system that over-emphasises
                        downstream R&D while weakening its upstream discovery
                        base risks narrowing the pipeline of ideas and becoming
                        increasingly dependent on technologies and intellectual
                        property developed elsewhere, ultimately rendering the
                        UK a follower rather than a leader in innovation.
                    </p>

                    <h3>
                        Early-career instability and international perception:
                        The irreversible risk of losing a generation of
                        researchers
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        We are particularly concerned about the effects of
                        funding uncertainty and delays on early-career
                        researchers. Uncertainty around the timing and stability
                        of postdoctoral recruitment is already influencing
                        career decision-making. In funding systems that
                        emphasise flexibility, dynamic allocation, and
                        programme-level adjustment, early-career positions
                        frequently become the primary mechanism through which
                        uncertainty is absorbed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This disproportionately affects early-career
                        researchers, who are uniquely mobile. When career
                        pathways collapse or appear insecure, they do not pause
                        their work; they relocate, often permanently, to systems
                        with clearer long-term commitments to discovery science.
                        Once dispersed internationally, this talent cannot be
                        rapidly reassembled in future funding cycles. The
                        consequences of this attrition extend far beyond
                        academia, it:
                    </p>
                    <ul text-align="left">
                        <li>
                            removes the next generation of research leaders and
                            educators before they can establish UK-based
                            programmes;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            weakens the pipeline into industry, defence, and
                            emerging technology sectors;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            erodes the UK's influence within international
                            scientific collaborations and research
                            infrastructure;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            reduces sovereign capacity to respond to future
                            strategic and technological challenges.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        While the full impact of these losses may take several
                        years to materialise, by the time they are visible they
                        are no longer reversible. For this reason, early-career
                        outcomes should be treated as a leading indicator of
                        system health under the new funding model.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At present, despite being the group most directly
                        exposed to this risk, early-career researchers remain
                        under-represented in many strategic and advisory
                        processes that shape funding priorities and
                        implementation. Ensuring their meaningful involvement
                        would strengthen decision-making and reduce the risk of
                        unintended capability loss.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, the prioritisation mechanisms described,
                        including reductions in new grants, project-level
                        viability assessments, and delayed portfolio decisions,
                        place the greatest effective uncertainty on fixed-term
                        researchers. In practice, postdoctoral recruitment,
                        contract renewal, and fellowship bridging become the
                        primary adjustable parameters during periods of
                        transition, even when early-career sustainability is not
                        an explicit target of cuts.

                    <p>
                        By contrast, infrastructure, facilities, and large
                        programmes can often be stabilised or re-expanded once
                        funding conditions improve; early-career cohorts lost
                        during a contraction cannot.

                        resilience
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        The UK is internationally recognised for excellence in
                        scientific discovery. Where it has historically
                        underperformed is not in generating ideas, but in
                        translating them into sustained domestic, economic, and
                        industrial value through scale-up, long-term capital,
                        and talent retention. Increased emphasis on downstream
                        innovation and commercialisation is therefore both
                        necessary and welcome.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, these downstream interventions depend
                        critically on the continued strength, breadth, and
                        stability of the upstream discovery ecosystem that feeds
                        them. There is a risk that an overly narrow
                        interpretation of “doing fewer things better” could
                        unintentionally reduce capability in areas of
                        fundamental science whose contributions are long-term,
                        enabling, and interdisciplinary.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Over-concentration may improve short-term coherence, but
                        it reduces the diversity and resilience of the discovery
                        base from which future technologies emerge. Once
                        research areas fall below a critical mass, particularly
                        through early-career attrition, recovery becomes slow,
                        uncertain, and ultimately costly. Safeguarding breadth
                        within curiosity-driven research is therefore not in
                        tension with strategic focus; it is a necessary
                        condition for sustaining the innovation pipeline that
                        downstream investment seeks to strengthen.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Path forward: A strategic correction is required</h3>

                    <p>
                        The principal risk in the current funding approach is
                        not one of communication, transition timing, or process.
                        It is the effective definition of value being applied in
                        prioritisation decisions. If fundamental research is
                        assessed primarily through near-term market relevance or
                        short-horizon deliverables, the consequence is
                        systematic and unavoidable: areas of discovery science
                        that generate new technological directions, skills, and
                        the people who sustain future capability over longer
                        timescales are selected against by construction.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Curiosity-driven research is not an early stage of a
                        linear pipeline waiting for translation. It is the part
                        of the system that determines which technologies,
                        industries, and applications become possible in the
                        first place. A funding framework that concentrates
                        investment using short-term impact criteria therefore
                        risks hollowing out precisely the upstream capability it
                        seeks to protect. If this assessment logic is not
                        corrected, measures aimed at stabilising recruitment or
                        improving process will be insufficient, because the
                        underlying scientific base will already have fallen
                        below a sustainable critical mass.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This dynamic is particularly acute in the current PPAN
                        re-prioritisation process. When people and facilities
                        are funded from the same sources, the system adjusts by
                        cutting or delaying people. Postdoctoral recruitment,
                        contract renewal, and fellowship continuity become the
                        levers through which change is absorbed. Early-career
                        researchers therefore carry the cost of
                        re-prioritisation, despite being the least able to
                        absorb it and the most likely to leave, resulting in a
                        permanent reduction in future capability and a direct
                        loss of inputs to the UK’s science and technology base.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Avoiding irreversible loss of capability requires
                        implementation safeguards that bind decision-making, not
                        statements of intent. We therefore urge UKRI and the
                        Department for Science, Innovation and Technology to
                        adopt the following as minimum requirements:

                        We stand ready to engage constructively. However, the
                        success of the new funding framework will ultimately be
                        judged not by restated commitments to curiosity-driven
                        research, but by whether the UK retains a viable
                        early-career pipeline and a critical mass of fundamental
                        capability by the time the transition is complete.
                        Crucially, significant harm is already being incurred
                        during the transition: uncertainty and delayed
                        opportunities are dispersing early-career talent before
                        any material savings are realised or strategic benefits
                        can take effect. Losses incurred during this period will
                        not be recoverable on Spending Review timescales,
                        regardless of future budget growth.
